2. Please select one piece of public research you have read in recent months that you found interesting and applicable to a Major League coaching staff.  Write a one-paragraph summary on that article that would be appropriate to send to an entire Major League coaching staff and analytics department.

3. Suppose you have two SQL tables with the following data for seasons 2010 to current (column names in parentheses):
    - **TEAM** contains team-specific information (SEASON, TEAM_ID, TEAM_NAME, ORGANIZATION_ID, ORGANIZATION_NAME, LEVEL_NAME, LEAGUE_NAME) 
    - **STATS** contains team hitting statistics (GAME_ID, GAME_DATE, BATTER_TEAM_ID, BATTER_ID, INNING, PA, AB, ER, H, 1B, 2B, 1B, 2B, 3B, HR, SB, CS, CS, BB, SO, IBB, HBP, SF, SH)

        Write a sample SQL query to return Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP) constants for the 2019 season by affiliate level and league.
		
		```
		SELECT
			t.LEVEL_NAME,
			t.LEAGUE_NAME,
			SUM(s.ER) as lgER,
			SUM((CASE WHEN s.PA = 1 AND s.H = 0 AND s.BB = 0 AND s.IBB = 0 AND s.HBP = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) +
					CASE WHEN s.CS = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as lgOuts,
			SUM(s.HR) as lgHR,
			SUM(s.BB + s.IBB) as lgBB,
			SUM(s.HBP) as lgHBP,
			SUM(s.SO) as lgK
		INTO #FIPdata
		FROM STATS s
		INNER JOIN TEAM t
			ON YEAR(s.GAME_DATE) = t.SEASON
			AND s.BATTER_TEAM_ID = t.TEAM_ID
		WHERE t.SEASON = 2019
		GROUP BY
			t.LEVEL_NAME,
			t.LEAGUE_NAME
	
		SELECT
			LEVEL_NAME,
			LEAGUE_NAME,
			((lgER * 9) / (1.0 * lgOuts / 3)) - (((13 * lgHR) + (3 * (lgBB + lgHBP)) - (2 * lgK)) / (1.0 * lgOuts / 3)) as FIP_Constant
		FROM #FIPdata

		DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #FIPdata```
