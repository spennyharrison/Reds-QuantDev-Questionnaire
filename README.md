**1. Please use the data provided to complete this task.  Please be sure to include any code produced in your final response document.**
    - Create a single page pitcher summary report or dashboard that can be produced for any PITCHER_ID.
    - Produce your output for PITCHER_IDâ€™s 62, 149, and 512. Include this output in your final response document.

**2. Please select one piece of public research you have read in recent months that you found interesting and applicable to a Major League coaching staff.  Write a one-paragraph summary on that article that would be appropriate to send to an entire Major League coaching staff and analytics department.**

	According to [this article from The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/2584790/2021/05/13/psst-mlb-base-stealers-have-never-been-more-successful-and-heres-why/), MLB base stealers are more succesful than ever. According to the article there are a couple main culprits, but two stand out. One is more breaking pitches; more than 35% of all pitches this season have been breaking balls, and just over 50% have been four-seamers or sinkers. Second, there's a preference for catchers who frame strikes well. [Just three catchers have recorded a sub-1.9 throw to second base this season](https://twitter.com/KyleAGlaser/status/1392164990052814848), compared to 31 in 2015. The former point is particularly interesting in the current offensive environment and raises a couple of questions to dig into. First, can we predict when a pitcher will throw a breaking ball with enough accuracy to exploit it? And second, does the break-even point for base stealing shift if offenses continue to struggle the way they have this season?

**3. Suppose you have two SQL tables with the following data for seasons 2010 to current (column names in parentheses):**
    - **TEAM** contains team-specific information (SEASON, TEAM_ID, TEAM_NAME, ORGANIZATION_ID, ORGANIZATION_NAME, LEVEL_NAME, LEAGUE_NAME) 
    - **STATS** contains team hitting statistics (GAME_ID, GAME_DATE, BATTER_TEAM_ID, BATTER_ID, INNING, PA, AB, ER, H, 1B, 2B, 1B, 2B, 3B, HR, SB, CS, CS, BB, SO, IBB, HBP, SF, SH)

        Write a sample SQL query to return Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP) constants for the 2019 season by affiliate level and league.
		
		```
		SELECT
			t.LEVEL_NAME,
			t.LEAGUE_NAME,
			SUM(s.ER) as lgER,
			SUM((CASE WHEN s.PA = 1 AND s.H = 0 AND s.BB = 0 AND s.IBB = 0 AND s.HBP = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) +
					CASE WHEN s.CS = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as lgOuts,
			SUM(s.HR) as lgHR,
			SUM(s.BB + s.IBB) as lgBB,
			SUM(s.HBP) as lgHBP,
			SUM(s.SO) as lgK
		INTO #FIPdata
		FROM STATS s
		INNER JOIN TEAM t
			ON YEAR(s.GAME_DATE) = t.SEASON
			AND s.BATTER_TEAM_ID = t.TEAM_ID
		WHERE t.SEASON = 2019
		GROUP BY
			t.LEVEL_NAME,
			t.LEAGUE_NAME
	
		SELECT
			LEVEL_NAME,
			LEAGUE_NAME,
			((lgER * 9) / (1.0 * lgOuts / 3)) - (((13 * lgHR) + (3 * (lgBB + lgHBP)) - (2 * lgK)) / (1.0 * lgOuts / 3)) as FIP_Constant
		FROM #FIPdata

		DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #FIPdata
		```

**4. What player development technology do you feel is the most valuable for an organization to leverage and why? Please limit your response to one paragraph.**

	I think that depends somewhat on which technologies they are or aren't already leveraging. If the organization was starting from scratch, then I would say that utilizing radar and player tracking data from TrackMan/Hawk-Eye are most important, just to lay a foundation in terms of data. However, because MLB teams already leverage those data sources, I would say that biomechanical data capture technologies are the next thing on the list. The first is that they allow for the detection of mechanical changes or issues that can be identified to help prevent injuries. The second is you can fine tune swing or pitch delivery sequencing to create a more efficient transfer of force, and in turn help players generate more bat speed, pitch velocity, etc. I would consider high-speed video capture useful for the same reasons, although you don't get raw data out of that.
